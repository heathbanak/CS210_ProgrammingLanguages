Files for GroceryTracker project. Built in Visual Studio Code. Uses C++ to access Python.


•   Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
      - A program designed for a small grocery store to track the number of items they were selling for inventory purposes
      - Reads in a file of items sold in a day
      - Can output the following:
          1. Alphabetical list of items sold and quantity sold
          2. Prompt user for an item name, search for item and display the quantity sold
          3. Histogram reflecting the data
          
•   What did you do particularly well?
      - Formatting created an easy to read user screen
      - Utilized multiple classes to reduce the amount of repeat code and make program more readable
      
•   Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
      - File protection could be included; rather than simply stating that a file did not open/close, output what error occurred
      - Username and password so only employees of the store could view data
      - More data analysis functions and capabilities to support the business needs
      
•   Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support     network?
      - The most challenging aspect was choosing when to use a different class, as well as understanding the impact of creating an object or a pointer             using "new"
      - Another was ensuring that the connection of python went smoothly and that all files were in the correct location
      - cplusplus.com is a good resource for understanding data types and built-in functions

•   What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
      - Visual Studio Code
      - Using multiple languages together
      - Dividing code into classes and functions
      - Managing time within a project with multiple elements

•   How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
      - Descriptive comments
      - Clear names and titles
